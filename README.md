Initially this app was to be a Taco Making App but due to the limitations of the API I redesigned it to be a cocktail drink generator that lists the ingredients and instructions.
You can choose a random drink, search by drink name, or search by alcohol.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

To run it locally:

In the project directory, run npm install.
You can then use npm start to run the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3006 to view it in the browser.
